The human dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3 has been consistently implicated in 
several neuropsychiatric diseases but the disease mechanism remains elusive. In 
this risk synthesis, we have concluded that SLC6A3 represents an increasingly 
recognized risk with a growing number of familial mutants associated with 
neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. At least five loci were related to 
common and severe diseases including alcohol use disorder (high activity 
variant), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (low activity variant), 
autism (familial proteins with mutated networking) and movement disorders (both 
regulatory variants and familial mutations). Association signals depended on 
genetic markers used as well as ethnicity examined. Strong haplotype selection 
and gene-wide epistases support multimarker assessment of functional variations 
and phenotype associations. Inclusion of its promoter region's functional 
markers such as DNPi (rs67175440) and 5'VNTR (rs70957367) may help delineate 
condensate-based risk action, testing a locus-pathway-phenotype hypothesis for 
one gene-multidisease etiology.

Behaviors and disorders related to self-regulation, such as substance use, 
antisocial behavior and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are 
collectively referred to as externalizing and have shared genetic liability. We 
applied a multivariate approach that leverages genetic correlations among 
externalizing traits for genome-wide association analyses. By pooling data from 
~1.5 million people, our approach is statistically more powerful than 
single-trait analyses and identifies more than 500 genetic loci. The loci were 
enriched for genes expressed in the brain and related to nervous system 
development. A polygenic score constructed from our results predicts a range of 
behavioral and medical outcomes that were not part of genome-wide analyses, 
including traits that until now lacked well-performing polygenic scores, such as 
opioid use disorder, suicide, HIV infections, criminal convictions and 
unemployment. Our findings are consistent with the idea that persistent 
difficulties in self-regulation can be conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental 
trait with complex and far-reaching social and health correlates.

Previous research suggests an association of loneliness and social isolation 
(LNL-ISO) with schizophrenia. Here, we demonstrate a LNL-ISO polygenic score 
contribution to schizophrenia risk in an independent case-control sample 
(N = 3,488). We then subset schizophrenia predisposing variation based on its 
effect on LNL-ISO. We find that genetic variation with concordant effects in 
both phenotypes shows significant SNP-based heritability enrichment, higher 
polygenic contribution in females, and positive covariance with mental disorders 
such as depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol 
dependence, and autism. Conversely, genetic variation with discordant effects 
only contributes to schizophrenia risk in males and is negatively correlated 
with those disorders. Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate a plausible 
bi-directional causal relationship between LNL-ISO and schizophrenia, with a 
greater effect of LNL-ISO liability on schizophrenia than vice versa. These 
results illustrate the genetic footprint of LNL-ISO on schizophrenia.

Are some individuals diagnosed with ADHD prone to alcohol abuse? Consideration 
of two possible mediating factors for this susceptibility.

Some studies conducted on ADHD have found a statistically significant 
relationship between those diagnosed with the disorder and a higher 
susceptibility to abuse alcohol. However, other studies have found no such 
correlation, or have found this to be true of only a nonstatistically 
significant subset of the population of individuals with ADHD. This research 
found an answer to what may be causing these discrepancies in findings. Various 
studies on ADHD have discovered both biological and cognitive differences in 
some individuals with ADHD that may be responsible for this predisposition 
toward alcohol abuse found in a subset of the ADHD population. It is proposed 
that those individuals diagnosed with ADHD who also have a mutation in the 
dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and who possess a deficiency in functionality of the 
prefrontal area of the brain designed for planning and reasoning may be more 
likely to develop alcohol abuse.

Atomoxetine (brand name Strattera) is a non-stimulant drug used in the treatment 
of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is a selective 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and is approved for children aged 6 and 
older, adolescents, and adults. Atomoxetine is part of a treatment plan for ADHD 
that may include other measures such as psychological, educational, and social 
support. Because atomoxetine is not a stimulant or a controlled substance it may 
be used in individuals with tics or other side effects associated with 
stimulants, and in individuals who have a substance abuse problem (or have a 
family member with a substance abuse problem). The most common side effects 
associated with atomoxetine therapy include weight loss, abdominal pain, 
headache, dizziness, fatigue, and irritability. In addition, atomoxetine has a 
boxed warning on the increased risk of suicidal ideation in children and 
adolescents treated with atomoxetine. The CYP2D6 enzyme is involved in the 
metabolism of atomoxetine (and a quarter of all prescribed drugs). Individuals 
who lack CYP2D6 activity (“poor metabolizers”) will have increased levels of 
atomoxetine and an increased risk of side effects compared with CYP2D6 normal 
metabolizers. Approximately 7% of Caucasians are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The 
drug label states that for known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, the initial dose 
should only be increased to the usual target dose if symptoms fail to improve 
after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated (1). Atomoxetine dosing 
should be adjusted for individuals who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, individuals 
who are taking a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and 
quinidine), and individuals with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. However, 
different authorities have different dosing recommendations. The Royal Dutch 
Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) Dutch Pharmacogenetics 
Working Group (DPWG) provides dosing recommendations for poor, intermediate and 
ultrarapid metabolizers. For poor metabolizers, DPWG recommends starting with 
the standard initial dose and to consult a care provider if side effects occur. 
If the medicine is effective, but side effects occur, DPWG recommends reducing 
the dose and monitoring efficacy (2). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics 
Implementation Consortium (CPIC) also provide recommendations for different 
CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes. For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, CPIC recommends 
that if no clinical response is observed after 2 weeks of atomoxetine therapy, 
then a plasma concentration exposure check be used with an individual’s CYP2D6 
genotype to help clinicians guide dose selection and titration (3).

Liability to alcohol dependence (AD) is heritable, but little is known about its 
complex polygenic architecture or its genetic relationship with other disorders. 
To discover loci associated with AD and characterize the relationship between AD 
and other psychiatric and behavioral outcomes, we carried out the largest 
genome-wide association study to date of DSM-IV-diagnosed AD. Genome-wide data 
on 14,904 individuals with AD and 37,944 controls from 28 case-control and 
family-based studies were meta-analyzed, stratified by genetic ancestry 
(European, n = 46,568; African, n = 6,280). Independent, genome-wide significant 
effects of different ADH1B variants were identified in European (rs1229984; 
P = 9.8 × 10-13) and African ancestries (rs2066702; P = 2.2 × 10-9). Significant 
genetic correlations were observed with 17 phenotypes, including schizophrenia, 
attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depression, and use of cigarettes and 
cannabis. The genetic underpinnings of AD only partially overlap with those for 
alcohol consumption, underscoring the genetic distinction between pathological 
and nonpathological drinking behaviors.

IMPORTANCE: Suicide rates have been increasing among youth in the US. While the 
heritability of suicide risk is well established, there is limited understanding 
of how genetic risk is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young 
children.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether genetic susceptibility to suicide attempts (SAs) 
is associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study examined data from 
the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a population-based 
longitudinal study of 11 878 US children enrolled at age 9 and 10 years from 
September 2016 to November 2018. Youth reports of suicidal ideation (SI) and SAs 
were obtained from the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia 
at baseline and 2 subsequent years. After conservative quality control of 
genotype data, this analysis focused on 4344 unrelated individuals of European 
ancestry. Data analysis was conducted from November 2020 to February 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Children's lifetime experiences of SI and SAs were 
assessed each year from ages 9 to 10 years to ages 11 to 12 years. Polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) for SAs were calculated for ABCD study participants based on 
the largest genome-wide association study of SA cases and controls of European 
ancestry (total sample n = 518 612).
RESULTS: Of 4344 children of European ancestry (2045 [47.08%] female; mean [SD] 
age, 9.93 [0.62] years), significant associations were found between children's 
SA PRSs and their lifetime SAs with the most robust association in the follow-up 
year 2 (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18-1.75]; corrected P = 1.85 × 10-3; 
Nagelkerke pseudo R2 = 1.51%). These associations remained significant after 
accounting for children's sociodemographic backgrounds, psychopathology 
symptoms, parental histories of suicide and mental health, and PRSs for major 
depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (likelihood ratio test 
P &lt; .05). Children's depressive mood and aggressive behavior were the most 
significant partial mediators of SA genetic risk on SAs (mediation analysis 
P &lt; 1 × 10-16). Children's behavioral problems, such as attention problems, 
rule-breaking behavior, and social problems, also partially mediated the 
association of SA PRSs with SAs (mediation analysis false discover 
rate &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings indicate that there may be 
genetic factors associated with SA risk across the life span and suggest 
behaviors and conditions through which the risk could be mediated in childhood. 
Further research is warranted to examine whether incorporating genetic data 
could improve the identification of children at risk for suicide.

ADHD and smoking: from genes to brain to behavior.

McClernon FJ(1), Kollins SH.

Center, Durham, NC 27708, USA. mccle011@mc.duke.edu

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco smoking are among 
the most common and costly psychiatric and behavioral problems. The rates of 
co-occurrence of these two common problems are larger than expected by chance. 
Despite progress in identifying the neural and genetic substrates of each, the 
mechanisms underlying the high rates of comorbidity between ADHD and smoking 
remain largely unknown. We propose that ADHD and smoking involve dysregulation 
of dopaminergic and nicotinic-acetylcholinergic circuits and that these 
aberrations are likely to arise, at least in part, from genetic variations. This 
review describes an integrative model of the ADHD-smoking comorbidity, with an 
emphasis on shared neuropharmacological mechanisms. We first describe the 
prevalence of smoking among ADHD patients. We then describe how ADHD influences 
stages of smoking behavior (e.g., initiation, maintenance, and relapse). We 
review common potential genetic substrates of ADHD and smoking, focusing on 
genes that regulate monoaminergic neurotransmission. We review the behavioral 
and neuropharmacological bases of smoking and ADHD, focusing on the modulatory 
roles of nicotine on attention and behavioral control. Finally, we discuss the 
implications of this model for prevention and clinical outcomes.

Interactive association of dopamine receptor (DRD4) genotype and ADHD on alcohol 
expectancies in children.

Lee SS(1), Humphreys KL(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology.

Positive and negative alcohol expectancies (AEs) are beliefs about the 
consequences of alcohol use (e.g., happy, sad, lazy) and they predict patterns 
of adolescent and adult alcohol engagement in clinical and nonclinical samples. 
However, significantly less is known about predictors of AE in children, despite 
significant variability in AE early in and across development. To identify 
temporally ordered risk factors that precede AE, we evaluated the independent 
and interactive association of the functional 7-repeat polymorphism of the 
dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) genotype and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) with respect to individual differences in positive-social, 
negative-arousal, sedated/impaired, and wild/crazy AE in school-age children (N 
= 149) prospectively followed from 6-9 to 8-13 years of age. Controlling for 
age, sex, and wave, DRD4 7+ carriers reported more wild/crazy AE, but DRD4 was 
unrelated to the remaining AE domains. ADHD symptoms independently predicted 
higher negative-arousal, sedated/impaired, and wild/crazy AE, but not 
positive-social. We also observed a significant interaction in which ADHD 
symptoms positively predicted wild/crazy AE only in youth with the 7-repeat DRD4 
genotype; the same interaction marginally predicted sedated/impaired AE. No 
interactive effects were observed for the remaining AE domains. These 
preliminary results suggest that, among DRD4 youth, early ADHD symptoms predict 
that children will expect alcohol to have wild/crazy effects. We consider these 
results within a developmental framework to better understand pathways to and 
from youth alcohol problems.

Low dopamine function in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: should 
genotyping signify early diagnosis in children?

Gold MS(1), Blum K, Oscar-Berman M, Braverman ER.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and McKnight Brain Institute, 
University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. msgold@ufl.edu.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is present in 8% to 12% of 
children, and 4% of adults worldwide. Children with ADHD can have learning 
impairments, poor selfesteem, social dysfunction, and an increased risk of 
substance abuse, including cigarette smoking. Overall, the rate of treatment 
with medication for patients with ADHD has been increasing since 2008, with ≥ 2 
million children now being treated with stimulants. The rise of adolescent 
prescription ADHD medication abuse has occurred along with a concomitant 
increase of stimulant medication availability. Of adults presenting with a 
substance use disorder (SUD), 20% to 30% have concurrent ADHD, and 20% to 40% of 
adults with ADHD have a history of SUD. Following a brief review of the etiology 
of ADHD, its diagnosis and treatment, we focus on the benefits of early and 
appropriate testing for a predisposition to ADHD. We suggest that by genotyping 
patients for a number of known, associated dopaminergic polymorphisms, 
especially at an early age, misdiagnoses and/or over-diagnosis can be reduced. 
Ethical and legal issues of early genotyping are considered. As many as 30% of 
individuals with ADHD are estimated to either have secondary side-effects or are 
not responsive to stimulant medication. We also consider the benefits of 
non-stimulant medication and alternative treatment modalities, which include 
diet, herbal medications, iron supplementation, and neurofeedback. With the 
goals of improving treatment of patients with ADHD and SUD prevention, we 
encourage further work in both genetic diagnosis and novel treatment approaches.

OBJECTIVE: Alcohol use disorders are common conditions that have enormous social 
and economic consequences. Genome-wide association analyses were performed to 
identify genetic variants associated with a proxy measure of alcohol consumption 
and alcohol misuse and to explore the shared genetic basis between these 
measures and other substance use, psychiatric, and behavioral traits.
METHOD: This study used quantitative measures from the Alcohol Use Disorders 
Identification Test (AUDIT) from two population-based cohorts of European 
ancestry (UK Biobank [N=121,604] and 23andMe [N=20,328]) and performed a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. Two additional GWAS analyses 
were performed, a GWAS for AUDIT scores on items 1-3, which focus on consumption 
(AUDIT-C), and for scores on items 4-10, which focus on the problematic 
consequences of drinking (AUDIT-P).
RESULTS: The GWAS meta-analysis of AUDIT total score identified 10 associated 
risk loci. Novel associations localized to genes including JCAD and SLC39A13; 
this study also replicated previously identified signals in the genes ADH1B, 
ADH1C, KLB, and GCKR. The dimensions of AUDIT showed positive genetic 
correlations with alcohol consumption (rg=0.76-0.92) and DSM-IV alcohol 
dependence (rg=0.33-0.63). AUDIT-P and AUDIT-C scores showed significantly 
different patterns of association across a number of traits, including 
psychiatric disorders. AUDIT-P score was significantly positively genetically 
correlated with schizophrenia (rg=0.22), major depressive disorder (rg=0.26), 
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (rg=0.23), whereas AUDIT-C score 
was significantly negatively genetically correlated with major depressive 
disorder (rg=-0.24) and ADHD (rg=-0.10). This study also used the AUDIT data in 
the UK Biobank to identify thresholds for dichotomizing AUDIT total score that 
optimize genetic correlations with DSM-IV alcohol dependence. Coding individuals 
with AUDIT total scores ≤4 as control subjects and those with scores ≥12 as case 
subjects produced a significant high genetic correlation with DSM-IV alcohol 
dependence (rg=0.82) while retaining most subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: AUDIT scores ascertained in population-based cohorts can be used to 
explore the genetic basis of both alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders.

Parental substance abuse and function of the motivation and behavioral 
inhibition systems in drug-naïve youth.

It is hypothesized that the development of substance abuse (SA) may be due to 
imbalance in functions of the motivation-reward and behavioral inhibition 
systems in the brain. This speaks to the search for biological risk factors for 
SA in drug-naïve children who also exhibit motivational and inhibitory control 
deficits; however, this type of research is currently lacking. The objective of 
this study was to establish a neurobiological basis for addiction vulnerability 
using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in drug-naïve youth with 
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We hypothesized that children 
with ADHD alone would show higher activity in regions of the motivation-reward 
and behavioral inhibition systems than children with ADHD and a parental history 
of SA. Toward this goal we scanned 20 drug-naïve children with ADHD ages 8-13 
while performing an event-related reward task. High (N=10) and low (N=10) risk 
subjects were identified, based on parental history of SA. The effects of 
anticipation, conflict, and reward were assessed with appropriate linear 
contrasts, and between-group differences were assessed using statistical 
parametric mapping. The two groups did not differ on behavioral measures of the 
task. The fMRI results show heightened activation in the brain 
motivational-reward system and reduced activation of the inhibitory control 
system in high-risk compared to low-risk children. These results suggest that a 
functional mismatch between these two systems may represent one possible 
biological underpinning of SA risk, which is conferred by a parental history of 
addiction.

A number of studies over the last two decades have demonstrated the critical 
importance of dopamine (DA) in the behavioral pharmacology and addictive 
properties of abused drugs. The DA transporter (DAT) is a major target for drugs 
of abuse in the category of psychostimulants, and for methylphenidate (MPH), a 
drug used for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which 
can also be a psychostimulant drug of abuse. Other drugs of abuse such as 
nicotine, ethanol, heroin and morphine interact with the DAT in more indirect 
ways. Despite the different ways in which drugs of abuse can affect DAT 
function, one evolving theme in all cases is regulation of the DAT at the level 
of surface expression. DAT function is dynamically regulated by multiple 
intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways and several protein-protein 
interactions. In addition, DAT expression is regulated through the removal 
(internalization) and recycling of the protein from the cell surface. 
Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that individual differences in 
response to novel environments and psychostimulants can be predicted based on 
individual basal functional DAT expression. Although current knowledge of 
multiple factors regulating DAT activity has greatly expanded, many aspects of 
this regulation remain to be elucidated; these data will enable efforts to 
identify drugs that might be used therapeutically for drug dependence 
therapeutics.

Genetic factors are strongly implicated in the susceptibility to develop 
externalizing syndromes such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorder 
(SUD). Variants in the ADGRL3 (LPHN3) gene predispose to ADHD and predict ADHD 
severity, disruptive behaviors comorbidity, long-term outcome, and response to 
treatment. In this study, we investigated whether variants within ADGRL3 are 
associated with SUD, a disorder that is frequently co-morbid with ADHD. Using 
family-based, case-control, and longitudinal samples from disparate regions of 
the world (n = 2698), recruited either for clinical, genetic epidemiological or 
pharmacogenomic studies of ADHD, we assembled recursive-partitioning frameworks 
(classification tree analyses) with clinical, demographic, and ADGRL3 genetic 
information to predict SUD susceptibility. Our results indicate that SUD can be 
efficiently and robustly predicted in ADHD participants. The genetic models used 
remained highly efficient in predicting SUD in a large sample of individuals 
with severe SUD from a psychiatric institution that were not ascertained on the 
basis of ADHD diagnosis, thus identifying ADGRL3 as a risk gene for SUD. 
Recursive-partitioning analyses revealed that rs4860437 was the predominant 
predictive variant. This new methodological approach offers novel insights into 
higher order predictive interactions and offers a unique opportunity for 
translational application in the clinical assessment of patients at high risk 
for SUD.

Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor, was approved 
for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment in children, 
adolescents and adults. We searched the database PubMed/MEDLINE (2000 to October 
1, 2021). Only publications in English were considered. Atomoxetine inhibits the 
presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET), preventing the reuptake of NE 
throughout the brain along with inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine in specific 
brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The novel mechanism of 
atomoxetine also includes several new brain imaging studies and animal model 
studies. It is mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic drug metabolizing 
enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Atomoxetine is effective and generally well 
tolerated. ADHD is often accompanied by multiple comorbidities. A series of 
studies have been published suggesting that atomoxetine is effective in the 
treatment of ADHD symptoms for children with various types of comorbidity. In 
some cases, it is possible that atomoxetine may have a positive influence on the 
symptoms of comorbidities. Atomoxetine can be administered either as a single 
daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, and has a negligible risk of 
abuse or misuse. The latest guideline updated that clinical dose selection of 
atomoxetine was recommended based on both CYP2D6 genotype and the peak 
concentration. To have a more comprehensive understanding of atomoxetine, this 
review sets the focus on the mechanism, clinical efficacy and dosage regimen in 
detail, and also touches on those studies regarding adverse reactions of 
atomoxetine.

Stimulant dependence is heritable, but specific genetic factors underlying the 
trait have not been identified. A genome-wide association study for stimulant 
dependence was performed in a discovery cohort of African- (AA) and 
European-ancestry (EA) subjects ascertained for genetic studies of alcohol, 
opioid, and cocaine use disorders. The sample comprised individuals with DSM-IV 
stimulant dependence (393 EA cases, 5288 EA controls; 155 AA cases, 5603 AA 
controls). An independent cohort from the family-based Collaborative Study on 
the Genetics of Alcoholism (532 EA cases, 7635 EA controls; 53 AA cases, AA 3352 
controls) was used for replication. One variant in SLC25A16 (rs2394476, 
p = 3.42 × 10-10, odds ratio [OR] = 3.70) was GWS in AAs. Four other loci showed 
suggestive evidence, including KCNA4 in AAs (rs11500237, p = 2.99 × 10-7, 
OR = 2.31) which encodes one of the potassium voltage-gated channel protein that 
has been linked to several other substance use disorders, and CPVL in the 
combined population groups (rs1176440, p = 3.05 × 10-7, OR = 1.35), whose 
expression was previously shown to be upregulated in the prefrontal cortex from 
users of cocaine, cannabis, and phencyclidine. Analysis of the top GWAS signals 
revealed a significant enrichment with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes 
(adjusted p = 0.04) and significant pleiotropy between stimulant dependence and 
alcohol dependence in EAs (padj = 3.6 × 10-3), an anxiety disorder in EAs 
(padj = 2.1 × 10-4), and ADHD in both AAs (padj = 3.0 × 10-33) and EAs 
(padj = 6.7 × 10-35). Our results implicate novel genes and pathways as having 
roles in the etiology of stimulant dependence.

Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are treated for 
extended periods of time with the psychostimulant methylphenidate (MPD). The 
psychostimulants cocaine, amphetamine, and MPD exhibit similar structural 
configuration and pharmacological profile. The consequence of the long-term use 
of psychostimulants such as MPD as treatment for ADHD in the developing brain of 
children is unknown. Repeated treatment with psychostimulants has been shown to 
elicit adverse effects in behavior, such as dependence, paranoia, schizophrenia, 
and behavioral sensitization. Behavioral sensitization and cross-sensitization 
between two drugs are used as experimental markers to determine the potential of 
a drug to develop dependence/addiction. Although there are many reviews written 
about behavioral sensitization involving psychostimulants, scarcely any have 
focused specifically on MPD-elicited behavioral sensitization and 
cross-sensitization with other psychostimulants. Moreover, the response to MPD 
and the expression of ADHD vary among females and males and among different 
populations due to genetic variability. Since the interpretation and synthesis 
of the data reported are controversial, this review focuses on the adverse 
effects of MPD and the role of age, sex, and genetic composition on the acute 
and chronic effects of MPD, such as MPD-elicited behavioral sensitization and 
cross-sensitization with amphetamine in animal models. Animal models of 
drug-induced locomotor stimulation, particularly locomotor sensitization, can be 
used to understand the mechanisms underlying human drug-induced dependence.

Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. Lachman@aecom.yu.edu

The COMT gene functional polymorphism val(158)met is one of the most intensively 
studied variants in psychiatric genetics. Due to small effect size and various 
methodological issues, its role in various psychiatric disorders and behavioral 
traits has still not been unequivocally established. In this issue of 
Neuropsychopharmacology, several studies are presented supporting a role for 
COMT as a factor in cocaine addiction, brain reward activation, response to 
tolcapone, distractibility in ADHD, and fMRI bold response. The studies make 
important contributions to the growing literature that aim to establish an 
effect of this functional variant on behavioral phenotypes and treatment 
response.

Studies of the 48 bp repeat polymorphism of the DRD4 gene in impulsive,

Prior studies have reported an association between the presence of the 7 repeat 
allele of the 48 bp repeat polymorphism of the third cytoplasmic loop of the 
dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) and novelty seeking behaviors, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome (TS), pathological 
gambling, and substance abuse. However, other studies have failed to replicate 
some of these observations. To determine whether we could replicate these 
associations we genotyped 737 individuals from four different groups of control 
subjects, and 707 index subjects from four different groups of impulsive, 
compulsive addictive behaviors including substance abuse, pathological gambling, 
TS, and ADHD. Chi-square analysis of those carrying the 7 allele versus non-7 
allele carriers was not significant for any of the groups using a Bonferroni 
corrected alpha of.0125. However, chi-square analysis of those carrying any 5 to 
8 allele versus noncarriers was significant for pathological gambling (p 
<.0001), ADHD (p </=.01) and the total index group (p </=.0004). When the 
comparison included all 7 alleles the results were significant for gamblers (p 
<.0001), TS (p </=.003), ADHD (p </=.003), and the total group (p </=.0002). 
There was a significant increase in the frequency of heterozygosity versus 
homozygosity for all alleles for pathological gamblers (p </=.0031) and the 
total index group (p </=.0015), suggesting that heterosis played a role. In the 
substance abuse subjects a quantitative summary variable for the severity of 
drug dependence, based on the Addiction Severity Index, showed that the scores 
varied by increasing severity across the following genotypes: 44 </= 
heterozygotes </= 77 </= 22. Studies of other quantitative traits indicated an 
important role for the 2 allele and the 22, 24, and 27 genotypes. All studies 
indicated that the role of the DRD4 gene in impulsive, compulsive, addictive 
behaviors is more complex than a sole focus on the 7 versus non-7 alleles.

AIMS: 1) To investigate whether genetic liability to 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), indexed by polygenic risk 
scores for ADHD (PRS-ADHD), is associated with substance use disorders (SUD) in 
individuals with ADHD. 2) To investigate whether other individual- or 
family-related risk factors for SUD could mediate or confound this association.
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: ADHD cases in 
the iPSYCH sample (a Danish case-cohort sample of genotyped cases with specific 
mental disorders), born in Denmark between 1981 and 2003 (N = 13 116). 
Register-based information on hospital diagnoses of SUD was available until 
December 31, 2016.
MEASUREMENTS: We estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for any SUD as well as for different SUD types (alcohol, cannabis, and other 
illicit drugs) and severities (use, abuse, and addiction), with effect sizes 
corresponding to a comparison of the highest PRS-ADHD decile to the lowest.
FINDINGS: PRS-ADHD were associated with any SUD (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11-1.51). 
Estimates were similar across different types and severity levels of SUD. Other 
risk factors for SUD (male sex, age at ADHD diagnosis, comorbid conduct 
problems, and parental factors including SUD, mental disorders, and 
socio-economic status) were independently associated with increased risk of SUD. 
PRS-ADHD explained a minor proportion of the variance in SUD (0.2% on the 
liability scale) compared to the other risk factors. The association between 
PRS-ADHD and any SUD was slightly attenuated (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41) 
after adjusting for the other risk factors for SUD. Furthermore, associations 
were nominally higher in females than in males (ORfemales  = 1.59, 95% CI: 
1.19-2.12, ORmales  = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.98-1.42).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher genetic liability to attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder appears to be associated with higher risks of substance use disorders 
in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Ethanol is the most important teratogen agent in humans. Prenatal alcohol 
exposure can lead to a wide range of adverse effects, which are broadly termed 
as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The most severe consequence of 
maternal alcohol abuse is the development of fetal alcohol syndrome, defined by 
growth retardation, facial malformations, and central nervous system impairment 
expressed as microcephaly and neurodevelopment abnormalities. These alterations 
generate a broad range of cognitive abnormalities such as learning disabilities 
and hyperactivity and behavioural problems. Socioeconomic status, ethnicity, 
differences in genetic susceptibility related to ethanol metabolism, alcohol 
consumption patterns, obstetric problems, and environmental influences like 
maternal nutrition, stress, and other co-administered drugs are all factors that 
may influence FASD manifestations. Recently, much attention has been paid to the 
role of nutrition as a protective factor against alcohol teratogenicity. There 
are a great number of papers related to nutritional treatment of nutritional 
deficits due to several factors associated with maternal consumption of alcohol 
and with eating and social disorders in FASD children. Although research showed 
the clinical benefits of nutritional interventions, most of work was in animal 
models, in a preclinical phase, or in the prenatal period. However, a minimum 
number of studies refer to postnatal nutrition treatment of neurodevelopmental 
deficits. Nutritional supplementation in children with FASD has a dual 
objective: to overcome nutritional deficiencies and to reverse or improve the 
cognitive deleterious effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Further research is 
necessary to confirm positive results, to determine optimal amounts of nutrients 
needed in supplementation, and to investigate the collective effects of 
simultaneous multiple-nutrient supplementation.

The dopaminergic and opioidergic reward pathways of the brain are critical for 
survival since they provide the pleasure drives for eating, love and 
reproduction; these are called 'natural rewards' and involve the release of 
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and frontal lobes. However, the same release 
of dopamine and production of sensations of pleasure can be produced by 
'unnatural rewards' such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, nicotine, 
marijuana, and other drugs, and by compulsive activities such as gambling, 
eating, and sex, and by risk taking behaviors. Since only a minority of 
individuals become addicted to these compounds or behaviors, it is reasonable to 
ask what factors distinguish those who do become addicted from those who do not. 
It has usually been assumed that these behaviors are entirely voluntary and that 
environmental factors play the major role; however, since all of these behaviors 
have a significant genetic component, the presence of one or more variant genes 
presumably act as risk factors for these behaviors. Since the primary 
neurotransmitter of the reward pathway is dopamine, genes for dopamine 
synthesis, degradation, receptors, and transporters are reasonable candidates. 
However, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, opioid, and cannabinoid neurons all 
modify dopamine metabolism and dopamine neurons. We have proposed that defects 
in various combinations of the genes for these neurotransmitters result in a 
Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) and that such individuals are at risk for abuse 
of the unnatural rewards. Because of its importance, the gene for the [figure: 
see text] dopamine D2 receptor was a major candidate gene. Studies in the past 
decade have shown that in various subject groups the Taq I A1 allele of the DRD2 
gene is associated with alcoholism, drug abuse, smoking, obesity, compulsive 
gambling, and several personality traits. A range of other dopamine, opioid, 
cannabinoid, norepinephrine, and related genes have since been added to the 
list. Like other behavioral disorders, these are polygenically inherited and 
each gene accounts for only a small per cent of the variance. Techniques such as 
the Multivariate Analysis of Associations, which simultaneously examine the 
contribution of multiple genes, hold promise for understanding the genetic make 
up of polygenic disorders.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders are 
commonly observed together, particularly in clinical populations of adolescents. 
The co-occurrence of these problems is common and presents challenges for the 
clinician in assessment and management. This article will review the extent of 
the problem, the relationship in terms of risk and prognosis, and management 
issues, including the use of stimulant and nonstimulant medications and the risk 
of abuse, misuse, and diversion.

It is now generally accepted that complex mental disorders are the results of 
interplay between genetic and environmental factors. This holds out the prospect 
that by studying G x E interplay we can explain individual variation in 
vulnerability and resilience to environmental hazards in the development of 
mental disorders. Furthermore studying G x E findings may give insights in 
neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorder and so improve individualized 
treatment and potentially prevention. In this paper, we provide an overview of 
the state of field with regard to G x E in mental disorders. Strategies for G x 
E research are introduced. G x E findings from selected mental disorders with 
onset in childhood or adolescence are reviewed [such as depressive disorders, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity, schizophrenia and 
substance use disorders]. Early seminal studies provided evidence for G x E in 
the pathogenesis of depression implicating 5-HTTLPR, and conduct problems 
implicating MAOA. Since then G x E effects have been seen across a wide range of 
mental disorders (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder) 
implicating a wide range of measured genes and measured environments (e.g., 
pre-, peri- and postnatal influences of both a physical and a social nature). To 
date few of these G x E effects have been sufficiently replicated. Indeed 
meta-analyses have raised doubts about the robustness of even the most well 
studied findings. In future we need larger, sufficiently powered studies that 
include a detailed and sophisticated characterization of both phenotype and the 
environmental risk.

City, USA.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is probably the most common 
chronic undiagnosed psychiatric disorder in adults. It is characterized by 
inattention and distractibility, restlessness, labile mood, quick temper, 
overactivity, disorganization, and impulsivity. It is always preceded by the 
childhood diagnosis, a disorder that is rarely inquired about, and usually 
overlooked. Treatment can be dramatically effective. Approximately two thirds of 
adult ADHD patients experience moderate-to-marked improvement with 
psychoeducational management and stimulant drug therapy.

BACKGROUND: ADHD and alcoholism are psychiatric diseases with pathophysiology 
related to dopamine system. DAT1 belongs to the SLC6 family of transporters and 
is involved in the regulation of extracellular dopamine levels. A 40 bp variable 
number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of 
DAT1/SLC6A3 gene was previously reported to be associated with various 
phenotypes involving disturbed regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission.
METHODS: A total of 1312 subjects were included and genotyped for 40 bp VNTR 
polymorphism of DAT1/SLC6A3 gene in this study (441 alcoholics, 400 
non-alcoholic controls, 218 ADHD children and 253 non ADHD children). Using 
miRBase software, we have performed a computer analysis of VNTR part of DAT1 
gene for presence of miRNA binding sites.
RESULTS: We have found significant relationships between ADHD and the 40 bp VNTR 
polymorphisms of DAT1/SLC6A3 gene (P < 0.01). The 9/9 genotype appeared to 
reduce the risk of ADHD about 0.4-fold (p < 0.04). We also noted an occurrence 
of rare genotypes in ADHD (frequency different from controls at p < 0.01). No 
association between alcoholism and genotype frequencies of 40 bp VNTR 
polymorphism of DAT1/SLC6A3 gene has been detected.
CONCLUSIONS: We have found an association between 40 bp VNTR polymorphism of 
DAT1/SLC6A3 gene and ADHD in the Czech population; in a broad agreement with 
studies in other population samples. Furthermore, we detected rare genotypes 
8/10, 7/10 and 10/11 present in ADHD boys only and identified miRNAs that should 
be looked at as potential novel targets in the research on ADHD.

BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbid with 
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) and substance 
abuse/dependence seems to represent a specific subset within the phenotypic ADHD 
spectrum.
METHODS: We applied complex segregation and linkage analyses in a set of 
multigenerational families densely segregating ADHD comorbid with ODD, CD, 
alcohol abuse/dependence, and nicotine dependence.
RESULTS: Our data suggest that ADHD cosegregates with disruptive behaviors as a 
unique, phenotypically variable trait as evidenced by highly significant 
pair-wise linkages among: ADHD and ODD (logarithm of odds [LOD]=14.19), ADHD and 
CD (LOD=5.34), ODD and CD (LOD=6.68), and CD and alcohol abuse/dependence 
(LOD=3.98). In addition to previously reported ADHD susceptibility loci, we 
found evidence of linkage for comorbid ADHD phenotypes to loci at 8q24, 
2p21-22.3, 5p13.1-p13.3, 12p11.23-13.3, 8q15, and 14q21.1-22.2. These results 
were replicated with an affected status phenotype derived from latent class 
clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of cosegregation of ADHD with comorbidities can inform our 
understanding of the inheritance patterns not only of ADHD but also of 
disruptive behavioral disorders and alcohol abuse/dependence. Refining the 
comorbid ADHD phenotype by determining the cosegregation profile of specific 
comorbidities might be a powerful tool for defining significant regions of 
linkage.

Traditional models of future alcohol use in adolescents have used 
variable-centered approaches, predicting alcohol use from a set of variables 
across entire samples or populations. Following the proposition that predictive 
factors may vary in adolescents as a function of family history, we used a 
two-pronged approach by first defining clusters of familial risk, followed by 
prediction analyses within each cluster. Thus, for the first time in 
adolescents, we tested whether adolescents with a family history of drug abuse 
exhibit a set of predictors different from adolescents without a family history. 
We apply this approach to a genetic risk score and individual differences in 
personality, cognition, behavior (risk-taking and discounting) substance use 
behavior at age 14, life events, and functional brain imaging, to predict scores 
on the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) at age 14 and 16 in a 
sample of adolescents (N = 1659 at baseline, N = 1327 at follow-up) from the 
IMAGEN cohort, a longitudinal community-based cohort of adolescents. In the 
absence of familial risk (n = 616), individual differences in baseline drinking, 
personality measures (extraversion, negative thinking), discounting behaviors, 
life events, and ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation were 
significantly associated with future AUDIT scores, while the overall model 
explained 22% of the variance in future AUDIT. In the presence of familial risk 
(n = 711), drinking behavior at age 14, personality measures (extraversion, 
impulsivity), behavioral risk-taking, and life events were significantly 
associated with future AUDIT scores, explaining 20.1% of the overall variance. 
Results suggest that individual differences in personality, cognition, life 
events, brain function, and drinking behavior contribute differentially to the 
prediction of future alcohol misuse. This approach may inform more 
individualized preventive interventions.

Here we summarize evidence obtained by our group during the last two decades, 
and contrasted it with a review of related data from the available literature to 
show that behavioral syndromes involving attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), externalizing disorders, and substance-use disorder (SUD) share 
similar signs and symptoms (i.e., have a biological basis as common syndromes), 
physiopathological and psychopathological mechanisms, and genetic factors. 
Furthermore, we will show that the same genetic variants harbored in different 
genes are associated with different syndromes and that non-linear interactions 
between genetic variants (epistasis) best explain phenotype severity, long-term 
outcome, and response to treatment. These data have been depicted in our studies 
by extended pedigrees, where ADHD, externalizing symptoms, and SUD segregate and 
co-segregate. Finally, we applied here a new formal network analysis using the 
set of significantly replicated genes that have been shown to be either 
associated and/or linked to ADHD, disruptive behaviors, and SUD in order to 
detect significantly enriched gene categories for protein and genetic 
interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization, and protein domain 
similarity. We found that networks related to pathways involved in axon 
guidance, regulation of synaptic transmission, and regulation of transmission of 
nerve impulse are overrepresented. In summary, we provide compiled evidence of 
complex networks of genotypes underlying a wide phenotype that involves SUD and 
externalizing disorders.

Substance use disorder (SUD) often co-occur at high prevalence with other 
psychiatric conditions. Among them, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) is present in almost one out of every four subjects with SUD and is 
associated with higher severity, more frequent polysubstance dependence and 
increased risk for other mental health problems in SUD patients. Despite studies 
suggesting a genetic basis in the co-occurrence of these two conditions, the 
genetic factors involved in the joint development of both disorders and the 
mechanisms mediating these causal relationships are still unknown. In this 
study, we tested whether the genetic liability to five SUD-related phenotypes 
share a common background in the general population and clinically diagnosed 
ADHD individuals from an in-house sample of 989 subjects and further explored 
the genetic overlap and the causal relationship between ADHD and SUD using 
pre-existing GWAS datasets. Our results confirm a common genetic background 
between ADHD and SUD and support the current literature on the causal effect of 
the liability to ADHD on the risk for SUD. We added novel findings on the effect 
of the liability of lifetime cannabis use on ADHD and found evidence of shared 
genetic background underlying SUD in general population and in ADHD, at least 
for lifetime cannabis use, alcohol dependence and smoking initiation. These 
findings are in agreement with the high comorbidity observed between ADHD and 
SUD and highlight the need to control for substance use in ADHD and to screen 
for ADHD comorbidity in all SUD patients to provide optimal clinical 
interventions.

OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to use familial risk analysis to 
examine the association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
and substance use disorders (SUDs) attending to sex effects and the specificity 
of alcohol and drug use disorder risks.
METHODS: Subjects were derived from two longitudinal case-control family studies 
of probands aged 6-17 years with and without DSM-III-R ADHD of both sexes and 
their first degree relatives followed from childhood onto young adult years. Cox 
proportional hazard models were used to estimate rates of ADHD and SUDs (any 
SUD, alcohol dependence, and drug dependence). Logistic regression was used to 
test both co-segregation and assortative mating.
RESULTS: Our sample included 404 probands (ADHD: 112 boys and 96 girls; Control: 
105 boys and 91 girls) and their 1336 relatives. SUDs in probands increased the 
risk for SUDs in relatives irrespective of ADHD status. The risk for dependence 
to drug or alcohol in relatives was non-specific. There was evidence that even 
in the absence of a SUD in the proband, ADHD by itself increased the risk of 
SUDs in relatives. Proband sex did not moderate the familial relationship 
between ADHD and SUDs. There was evidence of co-segregation between ADHD and 
SUD.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that various independent pathways are involved in 
the transmission of SUD in ADHD and that these risks were not moderated by 
proband sex. ADHD children and siblings should benefit from preventive and early 
intervention strategies to decrease their elevated risk for developing a SUD.

BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in genes such as DAT1, 5HTTLPR, D4DR4, and MAO-A have 
been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
susceptibility for opiate addiction. We investigated in opiate-addicted parents 
and their children the rate of ADHD and genetic markers that could predict 
susceptibility to ADHD and/or opiate addiction.
METHODS: We studied 64 heroin-addicted, methadone-maintained parents, and their 
94 children who had or had not been exposed prenatally to opiates. DNA extracted 
from mouthwash was assessed for genetic polymorphism for six polymorphic sites 
of four different genes. Study subjects also filled a variety of questionnaires 
assessing the rate of ADHD in the parents and children and the children's 
intelligence quotient.
RESULTS: Children of opiate-dependent mothers had a higher rate of ADHD compared 
to those of the opiate-dependent fathers. Opiate-dependent parents have a high 
risk of being carriers of most risk alleles examined except DRD4EX3 (allele 7). 
There was no difference whether the addicted parents had or did not have ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic and dopaminergic risk alleles seem to be mainly 
related to opiate dependence with no effect on the occurrence of ADHD. People 
carrying those polymorphisms are susceptible to opioid addiction and not 
necessarily to ADHD.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SNPs within the dopamine transporter gene (DAT) 
are associated with quantitative phenotypes generated from drug frequency 
variables in an ADHD sample.
METHOD: 35 SNPs were genotyped in and around DAT. We developed a quantitative 
phenotype at each SNP by weighting the drug frequency variables. The weights 
were selected to maximize the heritability at each SNP. Once a quantitative 
phenotype was generated at each SNP, a screening procedure was used to select 
and test the SNPs with the greatest power to detect an association in DAT.
RESULTS: No SNPs in DAT were associated with the quantitative phenotypes 
generated from the drug frequency variables after the multiple comparisons 
adjustment; however, some SNPs achieved nominal significance. A sliding window 
of analysis of 3 SNPs also resulted in only nominal associations.
CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in DAT do not appear to be associated with the phenotypes 
generated from drug frequency variables among individuals with ADHD.

PURPOSE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use 
disorders (SUDs) are highly comorbid and may share a genetic vulnerability. 
Methylphenidate (MPH), a dopamine transporter (DAT) blocker, is an effective 
drug for most ADHD patients. Although dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and dopamine 
transporter (DAT1) genes have a role in both disorders, little is known about 
how these genes influence brain response to MPH in individuals with ADHD/SUDs. 
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether ADHD risk alleles at DRD4 and 
DAT1 genes could predict the change in striatal DAT occupancy after treatment 
with MPH in adolescents with ADHD/SUDs.
METHODS: Seventeen adolescents with ADHD/SUDs underwent a SPECT scan with 
[Tc(99m) ]TRODAT-1 at baseline and after three weeks on MPH. Caudate and putamen 
DAT binding potential was calculated. Comparisons on DAT changes were made 
according to the subjects' genotype.
RESULTS: The combination of both DRD4 7-repeat allele (7R) and homozygosity for 
the DAT1 10-repeat allele (10/10) was significantly associated with a reduced 
DAT change after MPH treatment in right and left caudate and putamen, even 
adjusting the results for potential confounders (P ≤ 0.02; R² from 0.50 to 
0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ADHD/SUDs, combined DRD4 7R and DAT1 10/10 could 
index MPH reduced DAT occupancy. This might be important for clinical trials, in 
terms of better understanding individual variability in treatment response.

Twin study of the relationship between adolescent 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and adult alcohol dependence.

OBJECTIVE: Adolescent problem behaviors such as conduct disorder and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often associated with 
alcohol problems in adulthood, particularly alcohol dependence. This association 
is partly a result of shared genetic liability. However, it is unclear whether 
ADHD, or an ADHD subtype, shares genetic influences with alcohol dependence 
beyond those also shared by conduct disorder.
METHOD: We evaluated phenotypic associations between adolescent conduct disorder 
and ADHD phenotypes with adult alcohol dependence in a population-based sample 
of adult male twins (N = 1,774). We then assessed genetic and environmental 
relationships among phenotypes using structural equation modeling.
RESULTS: Individually, conduct disorder and each ADHD factor were associated 
with adult alcohol dependence. Results from twin modeling indicate that a 
genetic factor common to conduct disorder and ADHD also loads strongly onto 
alcohol dependence. Even after controlling for genetic factors shared with 
conduct disorder and other ADHD factors, the hyperactivity component of ADHD 
shared significant residual genetic influences with alcohol dependence.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the genetically mediated association between adolescent 
ADHD and adult alcohol dependence is shared with conduct disorder, reflecting a 
generalized risk to externalizing behaviors. The significant residual genetic 
covariance between the ADHD factor hyperactivity/impulsivity and alcohol 
dependence implies that impulsive behaviors less destructive/harmful than those 
manifested by conduct disorder can be indicative of genetic risk for adult 
alcohol dependence. However, the ADHD factors inattention and forgetfulness are 
not uniquely predictive of genetic/environmental risk for alcohol dependence.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in a course of high prenatal alcohol 
exposure (hPAE) are among the most common causes of developmental disorders. The 
main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. 
The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with 
or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic 
predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms 
of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples. A 
borderline significance was found for the correlation between MPH side effects 
and the G allele of COMT (rs4680) (p = 0.04994) in all ADHD children. No effect 
of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) polymorphisms and the treatment 
efficacy was observed. The analyzed DRD2 and COMT gene polymorphisms seem to 
play no role in MPH efficacy in ADHD children with hPAE, while low-activity COMT 
(Met158) variant carriers may be more intolerant to MPH. The MPH treatment is 
effective in ADHD independent of FASD, although the ADHD-FASD variant requires 
higher doses to be successful. These results may help in optimization and 
individualization in child psychiatry.

Farmington, Connecticut 06030-2103, USA.

BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to test a hypothesis associating 
impulsivity with an elevated body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: To this end, we examined associations of BMI with putative genetic, 
neurophysiological, psychiatric, and psychological indicators of impulsivity in 
78 women and 74 men formerly dependent on alcohol or drugs. A second analysis 
was designed to test the replicability of the genetic findings in an independent 
sample of 109 women and 111 men with a similar history of substance dependence.
RESULTS: The results of the first analysis showed that BMI was positively 
correlated with Total and Nonplanning Scale Scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness 
Scale and the number of childhood symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder in women. It was also positively correlated, in women, with a GABRA2 
variant previously implicated as a risk factor for substance dependence and an 
objective electroencephalographic feature previously associated with GABRA2 and 
relapse risk. The second analysis confirmed that the correlation between BMI and 
the substance-dependence-associated GABRA2 genotype was reliable and 
sex-specific.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an elevated BMI is associated with genetic, 
neurophysiological, psychiatric, and psychological indicators of impulsivity. 
The sex difference may be explained by greater opportunities to eat and overeat, 
a preference for higher calorie foods, a longer duration of alcohol/drug 
abstinence, or previous pregnancies in women.

Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) dysregulation is associated with a variety of 
behaviors including novelty-seeking, approach avoidance, and ADHD. DRD4 has also 
been shown to interact with the environment to produce changes in behavior and 
longevity. The present study sought to examine the role of DRD4 on 
cocaine-seeking behavior in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test and 
determine its effects on extinction and reinstatement in adult wild-type (WT), 
heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice. Results revealed that all mice, 
regardless of sex or genotype, developed a similar acquisition for a cocaine 
place preference. Female DRD4 KO mice failed to extinguish their preference for 
the cocaine-paired chamber following the extinction period. Male DRD4 KO mice 
failed to reinstate their preference after a priming dose following successful 
extinction. No differences in locomotor activity were observed within drug 
treatment conditions due to genotype, and female mice displayed reduced 
locomotor activity during CPP conditioning compared to male mice. The observed 
effects illustrate the role DRD4 gene expression has on extinction and 
reinstatement, but not acquisition, of cocaine-seeking behavior.

It has been well-established that some adolescents diagnosed with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for 
cigarette smoking. Current research on the genetic basis of this association 
could ultimately translate into genetic tests capable of identifying 
smoking-prone adolescents with ADHD. In this study we examined 81 ADHD affected 
adolescents' (age 13-21) interest in genetic testing for nicotine addiction 
susceptibility. Fifty-seven percent of adolescents indicated a fair amount of 
interest or more in testing. Most adolescents indicated that the personal 
information revealed from testing would be either useful (29%) or interesting 
(37%). Implications for genetically-informed smoking prevention and cessation 
interventions in high risk adolescents with ADHD are discussed.

Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a complex psychiatric and 
neurodevelopmental disorder that develops during childhood and spans into 
adulthood. ADHD's aetiology is complex, and evidence about its cause and risk 
factors is limited. We leveraged genetic data from genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) and performed latent causal variable analyses using a 
hypothesis-free approach to infer causal associations between 1387 complex 
traits and ADHD. We identified 37 inferred potential causal associations with 
ADHD risk. Our results reveal that genetic variants associated with iron 
deficiency anemia (ICD10), obesity, type 2 diabetes, synovitis and tenosynovitis 
(ICD10), polyarthritis (ICD10), neck or shoulder pain, and substance use in 
adults display partial genetic causality on ADHD risk in children. Genetic 
variants associated with ADHD have a partial genetic causality increasing the 
risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Protective factors for ADHD risk included genetic variants associated with the 
likelihood of participating in socially supportive and interactive activities. 
Our results show that genetic liability to multiple complex traits influences a 
higher risk for ADHD, highlighting the potential role of cardiometabolic 
phenotypes and physical pain in ADHD's aetiology. These findings have the 
potential to inform future clinical studies and development of interventions.

Dopamine transporter gene associated with diminished subjective response to 
amphetamine.

Individual variability in responses to stimulant drugs may influence risk of 
stimulant abuse and treatment response. However, the genetic determinants of 
this variability have yet to be elucidated. The dopamine transporter is an 
important site of amphetamine action. Therefore, the dopamine transporter gene 
(DAT1) is a logical candidate gene to study. Using a drug challenge approach, we 
tested for association between DAT1 genotype and subjective responses to 
amphetamine in healthy adults. Volunteers participated in a double-blind, 
crossover design, randomly receiving placebo, 10 mg, and 20 mg oral 
D-amphetamine, and completed self-report measures on subjective effects 
including anxiety and euphoria. Subjects were genotyped for the DAT1 
3'-untranslated region VNTR polymorphism and divided into groups based on 
genotype: homozygous for nine repeats (9/9, N=8), heterozygous (9/10, N=36) and 
homozygous for 10 repeats (10/10, N=52). The effects of amphetamine on ratings 
of Feel Drug, Anxiety, and Euphoria were examined with ANCOVA. In 9/10 and 10/10 
subjects, amphetamine produced its expected effects of increased Euphoria, 
Anxiety, and Feel Drug (p<0.01). However, in 9/9 subjects, the effects of 
amphetamine were indistinguishable from placebo, suggesting that the 9/9 
genotype has diminished subjective response to acute amphetamine. Interestingly, 
recent findings also implicate the 9/9 genotype in decreased therapeutic 
response to the stimulant methylphenidate in ADHD children. The current findings 
have important implications for understanding the genetic determinants of 
variability in stimulant response and risk of abuse.

Impulsivity is a personality trait of high impact and is connected with several 
types of maladaptive behavior and psychiatric diseases, such as attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder, alcohol and drug abuse, as well as pathological 
gambling and mood disorders. Polymorphic variants of the SNAP-25 gene emerged as 
putative genetic components of impulsivity, as SNAP-25 protein plays an 
important role in the central nervous system, and its SNPs are associated with 
several psychiatric disorders. In this study we aimed to investigate if 
polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the SNAP-25 gene are in association 
with normal variability of impulsivity. Genotypes and haplotypes of two 
polymorphisms in the promoter (rs6077690 and rs6039769) and two SNPs in the 3' 
UTR (rs3746544 and rs1051312) of the SNAP-25 gene were determined in a healthy 
Hungarian population (N = 901) using PCR-RFLP or real-time PCR in combination 
with sequence specific probes. Significant association was found between the T-T 
3' UTR haplotype and impulsivity, whereas no association could be detected with 
genotypes or haplotypes of the promoter loci. According to sequence alignment, 
the polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of the gene alter the binding site of 
microRNA-641, which was analyzed by luciferase reporter system. It was observed 
that haplotypes altering one or two nucleotides in the binding site of the seed 
region of microRNA-641 significantly increased the amount of generated protein 
in vitro. These findings support the role of polymorphic SNAP-25 variants both 
at psychogenetic and molecular biological levels.

Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at 
increased risk of developing substance use disorders (SUDs) and nicotine 
dependence. The co-occurrence of ADHD and SUDs/nicotine dependence may in part 
be mediated by shared genetic liability. Several neurobiological pathways have 
been implicated in both ADHD and SUDs, including dopamine and serotonin 
pathways. We hypothesized that variations in dopamine and serotonin 
neurotransmission genes were involved in the genetic liability to develop 
SUDs/nicotine dependence in ADHD. The current study included participants with 
ADHD (n = 280) who were originally part of the Dutch International Multicenter 
ADHD Genetics study. Participants were aged 5-15 years and attending outpatient 
clinics at enrollment in the study. Diagnoses of ADHD, SUDs, nicotine 
dependence, age of first nicotine and substance use, and alcohol use severity 
were based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Genetic risk scores 
were created for both serotonergic and dopaminergic risk genes previously shown 
to be associated with ADHD and SUDs and/or nicotine dependence. The serotonin 
genetic risk score significantly predicted alcohol use severity. No significant 
serotonin × dopamine risk score or effect of stimulant medication was found. The 
current study adds to the literature by providing insight into genetic 
underpinnings of the co-morbidity of ADHD and SUDs. While the focus of the 
literature so far has been mostly on dopamine, our study suggests that serotonin 
may also play a role in the relationship between these disorders.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Based on neurochemical and genetic evidence, we 
suggest that both prevention and treatment of multiple addictions, such as 
dependence to alcohol, nicotine and glucose, should involve a biphasic approach. 
Thus, acute treatment should consist of preferential blocking of postsynaptic 
Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) dopamine receptors (D1-D5), whereas long term activation 
of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system should involve activation and/or release 
of Dopamine (DA) at the NAc site. Failure to do so will result in abnormal mood, 
behavior and potential suicide ideation. Individuals possessing a paucity of 
serotonergic and/or dopaminergic receptors, and an increased rate of synaptic DA 
catabolism due to high catabolic genotype of the COMT gene, are predisposed to 
self-medicating any substance or behavior that will activate DA release, 
including alcohol, opiates, psychostimulants, nicotine, gambling, sex, and even 
excessive internet gaming. Acute utilization of these substances and/or 
stimulatory behaviors induces a feeling of well being. Unfortunately, sustained 
and prolonged abuse leads to a toxic" pseudo feeling" of well being resulting in 
tolerance and disease or discomfort. Thus, a reduced number of DA receptors, due 
to carrying the DRD2 A1 allelic genotype, results in excessive craving behavior; 
whereas a normal or sufficient amount of DA receptors results in low craving 
behavior. In terms of preventing substance abuse, one goal would be to induce a 
proliferation of DA D2 receptors in genetically prone individuals. While in vivo 
experiments using a typical D2 receptor agonist induce down regulation, 
experiments in vitro have shown that constant stimulation of the DA receptor 
system via a known D2 agonist results in significant proliferation of D2 
receptors in spite of genetic antecedents. In essence, D2 receptor stimulation 
signals negative feedback mechanisms in the mesolimbic system to induce mRNA 
expression causing proliferation of D2 receptors.
PROPOSAL AND CONCLUSION: The authors propose that D2 receptor stimulation can be 
accomplished via the use of Synapatmine, a natural but therapeutic nutraceutical 
formulation that potentially induces DA release, causing the same induction of 
D2-directed mRNA and thus proliferation of D2 receptors in the human. This 
proliferation of D2 receptors in turn will induce the attenuation of craving 
behavior. In fact as mentioned earlier, this model has been proven in research 
showing DNA-directed compensatory overexpression (a form of gene therapy) of the 
DRD2 receptors, resulting in a significant reduction in alcohol craving behavior 
in alcohol preferring rodents. Utilizing natural dopaminergic repletion therapy 
to promote long term dopaminergic activation will ultimately lead to a common, 
safe and effective modality to treat Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) behaviors 
including Substance Use Disorders (SUD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD), Obesity and other reward deficient aberrant behaviors. This 
concept is further supported by the more comprehensive understanding of the role 
of dopamine in the NAc as a "wanting" messenger in the meso-limbic DA system.

The shared genetic basis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
substance use disorders (SUDs) was explored by investigating the association of 
candidate risk factors in neurotransmitter genes with both disorders. One 
hundred seven methadone maintenance treatment patients, 36 having an ADHD 
diagnosis, 176 adult patients with ADHD without SUDs, and 500 healthy controls 
were genotyped for variants in the DRD4 (exon 3 VNTR), DRD5 (upstream VNTR), 
HTR1B (rs6296), DBH (rs2519152), COMT (rs4680; Val158Met), and OPRM1 (rs1799971; 
118A>G) genes. Association with disease was tested using logistic regression 
models. This pilot study was adequately powered to detect larger genetic effects 
(OR≥2) of risk alleles with a low frequency. Compared to controls, ADHD patients 
(with and without SUDs) showed significantly increased frequency of the DBH 
(rs2519152: OR 1.73; CI 1.15-2.59; P=0.008) and the OPRM1 risk genotypes 
(rs1799971: OR 1.71; CI 1.17-2.50; P=0.006). The DBH risk genotype was 
associated with ADHD diagnosis, with the association strongest in the pure ADHD 
group. The OPRM1 risk genotype increased the risk for the combined ADHD and SUD 
phenotype. The present study strengthens the evidence for a shared genetic basis 
for ADHD and addiction. The association of OPRM1 with the ADHD and SUD 
combination could help to explain the contradictory results of previous studies. 
The power limitations of the study restrict the significance of these findings: 
replication in larger samples is warranted.

AIMS: To examine the clinical and genetic characteristics of Korean male 
alcoholics with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: The present study included 85 male alcoholics who were diagnosed as 
having DSM-IV alcohol dependence. A total of 28 (32.9%) alcoholics were 
diagnosed as having DSM-IV ADHD with ongoing symptoms in adulthood. For the 
evaluation of their psychiatric conditions, the alcohol dependence scale (ADS), 
Beck depression inventory (BDI), Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), Barratt 
impulsiveness scale (BIS), brief anger-aggression questionnaire (BAQ), overt 
aggression scale (OAS), codependence test, and obsessive compulsive drinking 
scale (OCDS) were administered. The genotype frequencies of the dopamine type 2 
receptor gene (DRD2), aldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 gene (ALDH2), functional 
polymorphism in the regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene 
(5-HTTLPR), and catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) polymorphisms were 
examined.
RESULTS: Compared with alcoholics without ADHD, the mean ages for the onset of 
pathological drinking and alcohol withdrawal hallucinations were significantly 
earlier in alcoholics with ADHD. There was also a significant difference in the 
history of antisocial behaviour between the two groups. Compared with alcoholics 
without ADHD, the mean scores of the ADS, BDI, BAI, OAS, and OCDS were 
significantly higher in alcoholics with ADHD. With regard to the codependence 
test results, the mean scores of the interpersonal problem, low self-esteem and 
anxiety/fear subscales, and the mean total score of the codependence test were 
significantly higher in alcoholics with ADHD when compared with those without 
ADHD. There were no significant differences in the genotype frequencies of the 
DRD2, ALDH2, 5-HTTLPR, and COMT polymorphisms between alcoholics with and 
without ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the comorbidity of alcohol 
dependence and ADHD in this Korean sample forms a distinct clinical phenotype 
that shows an increased severity of alcohol-related symptoms and 
behavioural/emotional problems and that ADHD is associated with an increased 
risk for the early onset of alcohol dependence in Korean male alcoholics.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a neurotrophic factor for 
dopaminergic neurons with promising therapeutic potential in Parkinson's 
disease. A few association analyses between GDNF gene polymorphisms and 
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder and drug abuse have also been published but little is known about any 
effects of these polymorphisms on mood characteristics such as anxiety and 
depression. Here we present an association study between eight (rs1981844, 
rs3812047, rs3096140, rs2973041, rs2910702, rs1549250, rs2973050 and rs11111) 
GDNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and anxiety and depression scores 
measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on 708 Caucasian 
young adults with no psychiatric history. Results of the allele-wise single 
marker association analyses provided significant effects of two single 
nucleotide polymorphisms on anxiety scores following the Bonferroni correction 
for multiple testing (p = 0.00070 and p = 0.00138 for rs3812047 and rs3096140, 
respectively), while no such result was obtained on depression scores. Haplotype 
analysis confirmed the role of these SNPs; mean anxiety scores raised according 
to the number of risk alleles present in the haplotypes (p = 0.00029). A 
significant sex-gene interaction was also observed since the effect of the 
rs3812047 A allele as a risk factor of anxiety was more pronounced in males. In 
conclusion, this is the first demonstration of a significant association between 
the GDNF gene and mood characteristics demonstrated by the association of two 
SNPs of the GDNF gene (rs3812047 and rs3096140) and individual variability of 
anxiety using self-report data from a non-clinical sample.

Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance worldwide; 
around one in ten users become dependent. The risk for cannabis use disorder 
(CUD) has a strong genetic component, with twin heritability estimates ranging 
from 51 to 70%. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of CUD in 
2,387 cases and 48,985 controls, followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 
301,041 controls. We report a genome-wide significant risk locus for CUD 
(P = 9.31 × 10-12) that replicates in an independent population 
(Preplication = 3.27 × 10-3, Pmeta-analysis = 9.09 × 10-12). The index variant 
(rs56372821) is a strong expression quantitative trait locus for cholinergic 
receptor nicotinic α2 subunit (CHRNA2); analyses of the genetically regulated 
gene expression identified a significant association of CHRNA2 expression with 
CUD in brain tissue. At the polygenic level, analyses revealed a significant 
decrease in the risk of CUD with increased load of variants associated with 
cognitive performance. The results provide biological insights and inform on the 
genetic architecture of CUD.

Australian research in psychiatric genetics covers molecular genetic studies of 
depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For each 
disorder, a variety of clinical cohorts have been recruited including affected 
sib pair families, trios, case/controls, and twins from a large population-based 
twin registry. These studies are taking place both independently and in 
collaboration with international groups. Microarray studies now complement DNA 
investigations, while animal models are in development. An Australian government 
genome facility provides a high throughput genotyping and mutation detection 
service to the Australian scientific community, enhancing the contribution of 
Australian psychiatric genetics groups to gene discovery.
